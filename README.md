# Gradient Background Colors 😍 
This is a special project for me because I've used my 3 weeks of learning javascript into action. I might improve this project in future and deploy for the general public too, till then i want to work on other projects.

<h2> What's It All About? 😀 h2>
So, basically this is a site to generate random backround color which can be copied and used in css for cool looking background.

<br>

<h2> Why I'm Doing This 🎯 </h2>
Basically to test my knowledge on Javascript.
